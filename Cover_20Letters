1. Start by sharing your qualifications

Hi, my name is Rob and I have an MBA, experience in financial analytics, and have written content for over 50 highly satisfied clients here on Upwork – as you can see from the “Top Rated” freelancer badge on my profile. 

Although it’s a long and slightly wordy single sentence, it sums up who I am concisely.
Notice how I focus much of the attention on how I can benefit the client. I have business knowledge (MBA and work experience), keep my customers satisfied (beneficial for them), and am one of the Top Rated freelancers on Upwork (which means they will be getting the best).

2. Make it personal by asking a question
Your job description mentions your company is in New York. Are your customers exclusively from NY or do you work with clients nationally/internationally?

3. Explain why you’re interested in this project

As you can see from my own blog, MoneyNomad.com, I love writing about entrepreneurship and would thoroughly enjoy researching and developing blog posts for your website.

4. Share examples of similar projects

Here are some samples of articles I’ve written in the past:

http://moneynomad.com/6-ways-to-live-on-under-10000-a-year/


5. Vaguely explain your rate

I generally charge my B2B clients $0.30/word. However, because I enjoy writing about entrepreneurship and think your project would be a lot of fun, I may be able to reduce my rate slightly.

By stating the higher end for my blogging rates, and then mentioning that “I may be able to reduce my rate slightly”, the client will understand that I don’t write $10 articles, but he will recognize that he may not have to pay $150 for 500 words either.


6. Offer something for free


Finally, I would like to offer you a trial article risk-free. If you like it, you can pay for it and use it. However, if it doesn’t meet your expectations, you are welcome to improve upon it and use it for free. What topic would you like me to write about for this first post?
