The main duties and responsibilities of backend developers include:

    Write and manage API resources that can work across devices (to be used by front-end developers)
    Integrate elements created by front-end developers into the websites or applications
    Manage the exchange of data and information between the server and users
    
    
    
Step 2: Choose the right format for your backend engineer resume


There are 4 formats that you can use, they are:

    ** Chronological resume format
    ﻿List your work experiences in chronologically reverse order, starting with your current or latest work experience first, and work your way backward along your work history timeline. This format is a safe choice if you are unsure of which specific format to use because of how universally used it is. However, because it’s so general, it might not be able to highlight your specialty.
    ** Functional resume format
    ﻿In this format, your backend developer-related skills, qualifications, and achievements will be the highlight. Though it can be a risky format to use because of how focused it is on skills, it can work for entry-level backend developer resumes, student backend developer resumes, or backend developer CVs with gaps in between their careers.
    ** Combinational resume format
    ﻿As its name suggests, this format combines both chronological resume format with the functional resume format. In a combinational resume format, you highlight your relevant skills first and add your employment experience second in a reverse-chronological format.
    ** Targeted resume format
    ﻿A targeted resume format may be one of the most time-consuming resume formats to construct, as it requires you to tailor your backend engineer resume for every position you apply to. However, because of how tailored your backend developer CV is going to be, the results might be better and your resume will be more relevant to the job description.

How to Write a Senior Backend Developer Resume

Here’s how to write a resume of your own.
Write Compelling Bullet Points

The best way to make your resume stand out is to use specific examples and numbers. So rather than saying you “developed new features for web application,” you could say you “developed new features for web application, resulting in a 20% increase in user engagement over six-month period.”

The second bullet point is much stronger because it provides specific details about what you did, how you did it, and the results of your work.





Identify and Include Relevant Keywords

When you apply for a senior backend developer role, your resume goes through an applicant tracking system (ATS). This program scans your resume for specific keywords related to the job. If your resume doesn’t have enough relevant keywords, the ATS might not forward it to a recruiter.

One way to make sure your resume includes the right keywords is to read through the job posting and take note of the terms that are used most frequently. Then, add them into your resume where they’re most relevant.

    Backend Development
    Node.js
    JavaScript
    Amazon Web Services (AWS)
    Express.js
    AngularJS
    Python (Programming Language)
    RESTful Web Services
    Web Development
    Node.js Framework
    MySQL
    React.js
    Git
    jQuery
    Laravel

    Go (Programming Language)
    React Native
    ReactJS
    NoSQL
    Scrum
    Microservices
    Amazon S3
    Docker Products
    Java
    Spring Framework
    TypeScript
    Kubernetes
    PostgreSQL
    Back-end Development
    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)









Showcase Your Technical Skills

As a senior backend developer, you will be responsible for developing and managing the server-side of web applications. This will require you to have a strong understanding of server-side programming languages (such as PHP, Ruby on Rails, and Node.js), as well as experience with database systems (such as MySQL, MongoDB, and Cassandra). Additionally, you will need to be familiar with web hosting and server administration.

Including your technical skills prominently on your resume will show potential employers that you have the necessary skills and experience to be a successful backend developer.










*********************************************

The ATS algorithms

We don’t have to tell you how algorithms work, but we do want to remind you that you need to impress the Applicant Tracking Application before your resume lands in human hands. Match the keywords and phrases mentioned in the job listing to your targeted resume to give you the best shot at slipping past the ATS.

5 web developer resume writing tips

Knowing how to highlight your web developer skills will boost your chances of getting hired. Follow these five tips to make your web developer abilities stand out on your resume.





Tip # 1: Write a clear web developer professional profile

This short section aims to catch the recruiter’s eye and make them want to keep on reading. Introduce yourself with a concise paragraph at the beginning of your web developer resume. Pinpoint what makes you different from the other applicants. You can include your strengths, the web development projects that make you the proudest, or any other piece of information that’s crucial to get you hired.

Be brief and quickly flaunt your best web development skills and accomplishments. Remember, you still have one or two pages ahead to elaborate on this information, so don’t delve too much into it. Here’s your chance to give the HR department a snapshot of your main contributions to the field. Make it count and talk about that unique website you helped design, or mention your countless years of experience creating seamless apps.





Tip # 2: Show your human side and don’t make your resume too technical

Remember, web development isn’t always the HR department’s strongest suit. Trying to impress them by using complicated statements and extremely technical jargon might backfire on you. If there’s a simpler way to explain your qualifications, go for it, by all means. Doing so could be the fine line between hearing back from a potential employer or not.

Mix things up a little bit and keep a balance between your soft and hard skills. If you can’t help using complicated terms to define a particular web development ability, describe the actions and ideas associated with it. Use a few words to expand on how that skill maybe helped you solve a coding problem or increased your team’s productivity. Keep your sentences short, and steer clear from using passive voice. Try adding action words and power verbs instead.






Tip # 3: Be descriptive and provide tangible metrics on your web development accomplishments

Some recruiters might love name-dropping. It’s okay if you use your resume as an opportunity to show off those projects you’ve developed for big companies and high-profile clients. However, if you really want to get on the HR department’s radar, talk in numbers. Using concrete, measurable data to define your web development achievements will make your resume more engaging.

Speak the recruiter’s language. Offer appealing job descriptions that will make your web developer resume pop by including:

    Milestones
    Procedures
    Relevant duties
    Success stories
    Team feats







Tip # 4: Get rid of irrelevant or outdated information

Be selective when writing your web developer resume. Remember that less is more and that you need to prioritize the information that makes more sense for a particular position.

Most recruiters only spend about six seconds scanning through an applicant’s resume before deciding if they should move on to the next one. Cluttering yours with outdated coding courses and experience using unrelated software will decrease your chances of making a lasting impression.

Do emphasize your recent projects and relevant training. Don’t go further back than 10–15 years when describing previous jobs.







Tip # 5: Proofread—and then proofread again

There’s nothing more off-putting to recruiters than finding poor grammar and typos all over a web developer’s resume. Believe it or not, it says a lot about you as an applicant. Your potential employer might think you’re not interested enough in the position or that you lack the attention to detail required for the role.

Adding all the right information to your web developer resume is not enough if you don’t invest a few extra minutes ensuring your text is spot on. When in doubt, have someone else proofread the whole document for you and give you feedback. You don’t want lousy writing to get between you and your dream job.
